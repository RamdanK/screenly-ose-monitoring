## What is this?
<img align="right" width="400px" title="Monitoring Overview" alt="Monitoring Overview" src="https://github.com/didiatworkz/screenly-ose-monitor/raw/master/.github/IMAGES/manage.png" />
Screenly OSE Monitoring is a web-based application that is simultaneously installed on a Screenly OSE Player. With this tool, you can manage multiple OSE players via one interface.

In addition to its current display status, you can also manage the assets of a player. It is possible to activate or deactivate assets, add new ones, edit or simply delete them.

By installing an add-on on each player, it is also possible to display a "live feed" of the player's output. This will then be displayed in the overview, as well.
